Description: Sexual dimoprhic and COPD differential (SDCD) analysis
        contrasts regression coefficients from two stratified analysis.
        Stratification can be done in two ways: by COPD status or by
        sex. For COPD-stratified analysis, SDCD analysis contrasts
        sexual dimorphism between cases and controls, while
        sex-stratified SDCD analsysis contrasts COPD differential
        expression pattern between males and females. The package is
        meant to be used in conjunction with the package limma.
